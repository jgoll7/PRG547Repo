Repository for PRG547 Assignment
This Repo is home to a library of data structures and algorithms.
The project also has unit tests which confirm the expected result of each data structure's methods as well as the expected result of the algorithms.

The library contains the following data structures:
Array
Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Binary Tree

Each data structure is a generic data structure and can thus handle any C# objects of type <T>

The library contains the following algorithms:
Linear Search
Binary Search
Bubble Sort
